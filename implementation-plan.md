## Documentation Strategy

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
For every major architectural decision, document:
- **Context**: What problem are we solving?
- **Decision**: What solution are we implementing?
- **Rationale**: Why this approach over alternatives?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?

**Key Decisions to Document:**
- Why Active-Active vs Active-Passive for each service
- EIP pattern selection rationale for each integration point
- Custom component justification (what existing components couldn't handle)
- Clustering strategy decisions and their business impact
- Error handling strategy choices and their implications
- **Configuration management strategy** and environment promotion approaches
- **CI/CD pipeline evolution** and automated testing strategies

### Learning Portfolio
- **Pattern Showcase**: Document each EIP implementation with code examples
- **Failure Stories**: Document what didn't work and why (equally valuable for learning)
- **Performance Insights**: Document optimization decisions and their impact
- **Operational Learnings**: Document deployment and monitoring insights
